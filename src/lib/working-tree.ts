/**
 * The board's in-browser working tree, git-shaped — ported from the iterate
 * monorepo's repo IDE (apps/os staged-changes). Every path carries up to two
 * snapshots: `working` (live uncommitted edits) and `staged` (what the next
 * commit will take when anything is staged). Nothing here touches the
 * network; Commit flushes staged entries (or everything when nothing is
 * staged) through one `commitFiles` batch on the board session.
 *
 * Persistence: the whole map mirrors into localStorage keyed by project AND
 * HEAD commit oid, so a reload keeps your edits — but a HEAD that moved
 * underneath you (someone else committed) orphans the old key instead of
 * producing nonsense diffs against the new checkout.
